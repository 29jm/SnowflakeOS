# SnowflakeOS - Challenge Edition

SnowflakeOS is a hobby OS I started four years ago already with the goal of learning about the inner workings of operating systems, and for programming low-level stuff for the fun of it.  
I stopped developping it regularly shortly after starting the project as I no longer had the time because of school. This year, my school asks students to choose a task to work on, a challenge of their choice, and frees up some time to work on it. I've chosen to resume work on SnowflakeOS, and the work has begun!

## Objectives

The stated goals of development this year are the following:
- Displaying a basic user interface
- Being able to run a simple graphical program, such as a clock.
That makes only two goals, but they aren't the easy kind. Here is a non-exhaustive list of required features to complete those goals:
- Being able to run program in usermode
- Task switching
- System calls from userspace
- Program loading
- 2D graphics library
- GUI toolkit
Note that I don't intend to have the best scheduler, the best GUI, or great performance; but I want to have working versions of them, and to be able to show something working by June 2020.
